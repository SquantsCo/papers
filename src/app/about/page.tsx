        <p className="mb-4 text-sm text-slate-700">
          Squants.com is a focused space for the quantum community — combining
          paper explainers, learning paths, and (soon) a dedicated social layer
          where researchers, developers, and curious learners can meet.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-sm text-slate-700">
          The vision is to make quantum knowledge more accessible without
          diluting its depth. That starts with helping people read and
          understand research papers, then grows into collaborative projects,
          strategic alliances, ethical sponsorships, and member-focused
          subscriptions.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm text-slate-700">
          Over time, Squants.com aims to become a trusted hub where early
          students, industry practitioners, and academics can align — with a
          culture grounded in clarity, curiosity, and respect for both science
          and philosophy.
